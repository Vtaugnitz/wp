Numerous species and their varieties of citrus plants are cultivated in Central Europe as potted plants. In the frost-free period, ie from April / mid to October / November, they can stand outdoors and have to be cleared into winter quarters when the frost sets in. A bright frost-free conservatory offers itself as a year-round location. Low-growth species such as the bitter orange (Citrus aurantium var. Myrtifolia) can thrive on the windowsill year-round, but the location is not ideal. The fruits of the various species are all edible, but have in the cultivated as potted plants, especially ornamental value. The leaves of kaffir lime are suitable as a spice for Thai dishes.

Citrus plants are considered as species for theMediterranean garden design, as they embody the Mediterranean way of life like no other genus of plants. Already in the Baroque the trees were collected and cultivated by garden-loving princes in special orangeries. In the mostly unheated, south-facing glasshouses they were able to thrive all year round.
