The pomelo is the largest citrus fruit with up to 25 cm circumference and 6 kg weight. It is round to pear-shaped. The peel and pulp are pale yellow depending on the variety, then the pomelo is a little tart and bitter in the taste, until pink. The taste of the pomelo is spicy-sweet. Pomelo can be freshly used for spooning or for juice extraction. In itself, the pomelo has a coarse-grained and not so juicy pulp. On the German market pomelo are hardly included in the offer.
