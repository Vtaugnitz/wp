Regular cutting keeps the spicy, irregular growth-prone citrus plants compact. Therefore, the branches are shortened during the summer when they become too long. If larger crown corrections are required, then you choose the late winter, just before the citrus plants drive out fresh. This pruning may be done in the old wood. Wounds that are larger than a one-euro coin, you pass as a precaution with tree wax at their edges.
