Citrus plants are perennial, woody plants that grow shrubby or tree-like. Depending on the species they are between five and 25 meters high and are evergreen. It is typical that the young branches are green and edged, while older branches become roundish and their bark assumes a gray coloring. The shoots can be occupied with thorns. The transitional, dark green leaves are leathery and oval to oblong shaped. Some species, such as kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix), have widened and winged petioles.

The hermaphrodite, white or pink flowers are usually several in the Blattachseliate, rarely in terminal flower clusters. They smell and but from an aromatic oil. By steam distillation one wins from the flowers of the orange (Citrus sinensis) and the bitter orange (Citrus x aurantium) the so-called neroli oil, which is used for example in the perfume production. The flowering period usually begins after the end of the cooler season. The cultivated with us as potted plants species bloom at different times, depending on the fruit hanging and the hibernation conditions. New flowers set the plants only when the existing fruits are harvested. An exception are lemons (Citrus limon), because they can flower and fruit all year round.

The fruits, shaped very differently depending on the type and variety, are botanically among the berries. They are spherical to oblong, their ends are truncated round or provided with an angled tip. The shell is yellow, greenish or orange and contains numerous oil glands. The inside of the fruit consists of eight to twelve segments filled with juice sacs. The fruit contains 10 to 40 seeds. However, many cultivars are now seedless.
