Citrus plants can be extracted from seeds. They require a bright and sunny location for germination. However, the plants grown in this way flower and fruit only after many years. For hobby gardeners it is hardly worth bringing new plants. The commercially available cultivars are usually grafted, that is, a shoot of a particular variety is grafted onto a pad. Very often used as a base is the trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) or the bitter orange (Citrus aurantium).
