In the winter Citrus plants need a frost-free, but cool neighborhood. The temperature should be between 3 and 15 degrees depending on the type. The warmer the lodging is, the brighter it has to be. In a dark location, the plants throw off a portion of their leaves, but in the spring they usually go out again. During the winter, watering is reduced. The earth must not wet, but should not dry out. Make sure that the soil is soaked so far, so that the roots are also supplied with water at the bottom of the pot. Citrus plants are very sensitive when they are standing on a cold stone or tiled floor in winter quarters - they usually get yellow leaves within a very short time. In such cases place the pots on a wooden plate or a piece of styrofoam.
