<p id="tw-target-text" class="tw-data-text tw-ta tw-text-small" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Ãœbersetzung"><span lang="en">The grapefruit is the random cross between pomelo and orange and is smaller and less skinned than the pomelo itself. The peel of this citrus fruit and its pulp are light yellow to pink. The yellow-fleshed grapefruit are tart and bitter than the red-fleshed ones. The sour and refreshing juice of grapefruit is often a basic ingredient for exotic drinks. Grapefruit contains plenty of vitamin C and has a refreshing, tart taste. Grapefruit seedless grapefruit varieties are milder in flavor. The fine-sour to bitter-bitter pulp goes well with leafy vegetables, avocados and cream cheese. A halved grapefruit can also be delicious with sugar or honey grill. In addition, grapefruit taste excellent as a jam. When shopping, you should make sure that the grapefruit has a smooth, thin and resilient shell without pressure points.</span></p>
