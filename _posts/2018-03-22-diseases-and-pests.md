The infestation with pests is often a sign of citrus plants that the location or the care is not optimal and the plants are therefore stressed. Spider mites and especially scale insects in winter can be a problem during the summer . The latter can be combated with a spirit soap solution. Against Spinnmilben appropriate preparations from the specialized trade help. Covering the entire plant with a large foil bag increases the humidity and limits the vitality of the spider mites.
