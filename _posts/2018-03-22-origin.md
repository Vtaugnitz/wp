The genus of citrus plants (Citrus) belongs to the family of the rhododendrons (Rutaceae). There are about 13 species, with a clear distinction between them is not easy, since citrus plants have been in horticultural culture for millennia and crosses between all species are possible. As a result, there are numerous hybrids created by crossing that were once considered separate species. The variety of today's citrus plants is probably due to only three types, namely the lemon citron (Citrus medica), the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) and the pomelo (Citrus maxima).

The original range of citrus species is in the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It has been proven that tangerines (Citrus reticulata), kumquats (Citrus japonica) and grapefruits were cultivated in China as early as 800 BC. At the same time, lemon and lemon lemon were known in India. The first citrus plants probably arrived in the 4th century BC. About Persia to Greece. From there, these and later other species and varieties gradually spread throughout the Mediterranean.
