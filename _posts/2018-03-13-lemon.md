The juice tastes sour and contains plenty of vitamin C. Lemon juice flavored soft drinks and food. This citrus fruit can be widely used in the kitchen. A splash of lemon juice completes the taste of many spicy and above all sweet dishes. In a vinaigrette or marinade, it often replaces the vinegar and thin slices of raw meat or fish become tender and crumbly when put into lemon juice. In low-salt diets, citric acid can also replace the salt. For use as seasoning lemons can also be preserved in salt and vinegar.

Last but not least, lemon juice is used to preserve the color of cut fruits and vegetables, which discolour in the air after prolonged lying in the air and become unsightly. The main cultivation areas for lemons are in Italy, Spain and the USA. Lemons also need cold nights for their peel to turn yellow. The thinner the lemon peel, the more lemon oil it contains. The sour juice of this citrus fruit goes well with tender fish, fine ragouts, raw vegetables, salads and piquant pancakes all over breadcrumbs or refined mayonnaise. When buying lemons, you should only choose fruits that have a uniform color and no shriveled shell.</span></pre>
