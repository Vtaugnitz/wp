The oranges have many different varieties. The ordinary orange is a juicy, medium and heavy citrus fruit with a fine-pored shell. A seedless variant is the navel orange. The characteristic scar of this orange on the flower approach comes from a cultivated, smaller second fruit that absorbs the seeds of the large orange. The navel orange is also easy to peel. Blood oranges are characterized by a darker, sometimes deep red pigmentation of the pulp and often of the shell. They are low in kernels, taste stronger and a little tarter than bright oranges. The more intense the coloring, the more the blood oranges differ in taste from the ordinary oranges. The very dark blood orange is very sweet and has a pronounced aroma, which is reminiscent of the taste of berries. When buying oranges, be sure to select only firm and flawless fruits.
