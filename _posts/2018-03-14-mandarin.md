<p id="tw-target-text" class="tw-data-text tw-ta tw-text-small" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Ãœbersetzung"><span lang="en">The mandarin is the noble, small and slightly flattened sister of the orange. This citrus fruit is easy to peel and therefore good and easy to eat raw. Their tender and juicy pulp tastes particularly delicious. Mandarins can be crossed with each other well, creating numerous and ever new species. This makes the tangerine the most varied group of citrus fruits. Among the best-known mandarin types are the clementines, the Satsuma and the popular in the US tangerine. The Clementine is a very aromatic, deep orange tangerine, which contains a balanced acidity, a good aroma and usually no seeds. The Japanese tangerine Satsuma has a juicy pulp, but compared to other varieties tastes rather pale. Tangerine is considered the smallest type of mandarin, contains only a few seeds and is mild in taste due to its low acidity. When buying tangerines, you should choose fruits with an orange-red color and avoid those whose skin is already noticeably relaxed, as these often have been stored too long.</span></p>
