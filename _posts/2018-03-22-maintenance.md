Citrus plants are ideally outdoors during the entire frost-free period. The plants need a sunny spot, but the root ball should not overheat. This happens when a dark planter stands for hours in the blazing sun. The soil then heats up and the roots then restrict their activity - that is, they do not absorb enough water even in sufficient humidity to counterbalance the evaporation through the leaves. It then comes to wilting appearances. Citrus plants need a lot of water during the summer, usually they have to be watered daily. Fertilization takes place from March to October, preferably with a high-quality citrus fertilizer.

Citrus plants are repotted when the soil is completely covered with fine roots. The new planter should only be slightly larger than the previous one. As a plant substrate pure Torferde is unsuitable. It is ideal if about one third of the substrate consists of mineral additions such as lava pits, limestone quarry, loose clay break or chippings, gravel and coarse sand. A suitable period for repotting is March or April, so before the plant expires fresh. In late autumn and winter, ie in the dormancy, you should not repot, because the citrus plants in time no new roots and then it can cause damage to the existing root system.
